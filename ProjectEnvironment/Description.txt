Bakery Project descritpion:
---------------------------

Story line:
-----------
I’m about to run a bakery with the Internet app to manage bakery goods, so my customers can view what is currently on the shelves.

List of possible user stories:
------------------------------
US 1. As a bakery owner, I can add a bakery good to let the customers see what is currenlty fresh in sell. Conditions of satisfaction: Can I store product’s name and price? 
US 2. As a bakery customer, I can view all the fresh bakery goods in sell to step in. Conditions of satisfaction: Can I see product’s price?
US 3. As a bakery customer, I can check what is the most fresh bakery good right now in sell.

Testing exercise:
-----------------
The quality of the tests is something we value at Vonage. Please, propose test suite for the app. An automated test suite would make us smile.

How to run the app?:
--------------------
Please, follow Ubuntu or macOS README.rst to run the app.
It serves RESTful service with the following API:
GET /products
GET /products/{product-id}
GET /products/newest_id
POST /products

Example use:
------------
GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/products
output [{“id":"1","name":"Bread","price":"3.45"}]
POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/products with body {"name":"Bun","price":"1.2","id":""}
output {"id": "2"}
